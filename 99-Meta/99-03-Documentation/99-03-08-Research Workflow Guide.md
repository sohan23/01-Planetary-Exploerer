# Sea Level Rise and Coastal Erosion Relationship

## Papers Reviewed
1. [[02-XX-Understanding-Coastal-Erosion]] (Smith 2023)
2. [[02-XX-Sea-Level-Trends-Analysis]] (Jones 2022)
3. [[02-XX-Erosion-Pattern-Study]] (Lee 2024)

## Common Findings
**What all papers agree on:**
- Sea level rise accelerates coastal erosion
- Effect varies by coastline type
- Human structures complicate natural processes

## Contradictions & Debates
**Where papers disagree:**
- Smith (2023): Predicts 2m erosion by 2050
- Jones (2022): Predicts 3.5m erosion by 2050
- **Why the difference?** Different modeling assumptions

## Patterns I've Noticed
[YOUR original observations connecting the papers]

1. **Pattern 1:** Papers from 2020+ show higher erosion rates
   - Possibly due to improved measurement tech
   - Or acceleration of actual erosion

2. **Pattern 2:** Sandy coasts vs rocky coasts
   - Different erosion mechanisms
   - Need separate models

## My Synthesis
[YOUR original insights - this is the gold!]

The relationship between sea level rise and coastal erosion
is not linear. Based on these three papers, I see that:

[Your analysis connecting all sources]

## Research Gaps
**What's missing from current research:**
- [ ] Long-term studies (>50 years)
- [ ] Effect on different sediment types
- [ ] Role of vegetation in mitigation

## Questions Generated
- [ ] How does sediment grain size affect erosion rate?
- [ ] Can we predict which coasts are most vulnerable?
- [ ] What mitigation strategies actually work?

## Implications for My Content
[How this affects your YouTube/Blog content]

**YouTube video idea:** "Will Your Beach Disappear? Science Explains"
**Blog post idea:** "Understanding Coastal Erosion: What Research Says"

## Next Research Steps
- [ ] Find papers on sediment types
- [ ] Look for mitigation strategy studies
- [ ] Read more on prediction models
```

**✅ Good practices:**
- Wait until you have 3+ related papers
- Focus on YOUR insights, not just summaries
- Identify contradictions explicitly
- Generate new questions
- Think about content applications

### Step 4: Create Permanent Notes

**When:** After synthesis, when you have a clear concept

**Where:** `03-02-Permanent Notes/`

**What:** Atomic notes - one concept per note

**How:** Extract key concepts from synthesis notes

**Example from synthesis above:**
Create 3 separate permanent notes:
1. `Sea Level Rise Causes.md`
2. `Coastal Erosion Mechanisms.md`
3. `Erosion Prediction Models.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
---
title: Coastal Erosion Mechanisms
tags:
  - permanent-note
  - erosion
  - concept

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "I have 50 papers and no literature notes"
**Solution:** Start with most recent/relevant 3 papers

**Problem:** "My literature notes are too long"
**Solution:** Move details to permanent notes, keep literature notes focused

**Problem:** "I don't see patterns for synthesis"
**Solution:** Read more papers on the same topic (aim for 5+)

**Problem:** "Too much time on notes, not enough on content"
**Solution:** Set time limits - 20 min per literature note
