````

There are several things that has to be needed to successfully operate the YouTube channel from the day one.

The real things came down to few aspects depending upon some of the things which I will consider important.

## 1. Content
This is by far most important thing of any YouTube videos. The main thing is to have a niche of content to talk about.

Some of the topics I would love to address are as follows

- Remote Sensing - Now RS is very vast topic, but some of the verticals are 
	- Educating/ A character of storyteller to people about the history, future, and the importance of them in this day and edge is need can be one of the topics.
	- Educating to use free to simply use the Open-source or free to use tools to get insightful information. Giving access to information in the hand of people.
	- Making a simple breakdown of the instrument and it’s engineering behind them like real engineering and smarter everyday with a mix of veritasiam. If instagram them huge is true style.
```ad-note

Creation of business and selling templates of the notion and n8n workflow for the student oriented.

	1. Like, creation of tracker in notion automated with the n8n's automate workflow.
	2. Make a video to promote it on the YouTube and sell the template
```

## 2. Presentation
This section will have two things 

### How to present 
1. Hook of the content - Visual and Clickbait
2. One line description of the topic.
3. Content itself.
4. Cliffhanger —-> kind of for the next video retention.
5. Ending

### Editing
1. Thumbnail of the video.
	1. Nano-banana for the ideation.
	2. Canva for the actual editing.
2. Graphic or Non-graphic? - This is a conundrum. Simple logic is test with the Instagram reels, graphics are :BoBxsHot: Hot then okay, if not then Face. _Have to think about this particularly later_.
3. For editing software are needed
	1. For video editing - simple editing is needed {Capcut or similar for insta and if possible for the YouTube as well}.
	2. For audio - Audacity.


Several other things has to be sorted out also. We will do that in later times.
